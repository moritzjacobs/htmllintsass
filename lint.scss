/*
When HTML is written incorrectly, nothing much happens.
Because of this, it's easy to have invalid, unsemantic, or
unaccessible bits in markup without it being obvious.

There are many ways we can lint our HTML to discover and fix
these issues, for example using the W3C Markup Validation
Service. Another thing we can do, which can be more easily
integrated into a development workflow, is to use some slightly
advanced CSS selectors to highlight potential problem areas.
Here are a few things we can use CSS selectors to help us catch
out.
*/

@mixin highlight($message:"lint failed: â€¦") {
	border: 2px solid red;
	position: relative;

	&:after {
		content: $message;
		position: absolute;
		top: 0;
		right: 0;
		transform: translate(-50%, -100%);
		color: white;
		font-family: monospace;
		font-weight: bold;
		background: red;
		padding: 3px;
		border-radius: 3px;
		font-size: 10px;
		display: none;
	}

	&:hover:after {
		display: block;
	}

/*
## Inline Styles

This selector will target any element on the page that has
inline styles applied to it. As a general rule, inline styles
should be avoided as they are difficult to override due to
their increased level of specificity. Although inline styles
may be necessary in some cases, this selector will help
highlight them so a decision can be made on a case-by-case
basis.

With the problem elements selected, we can apply any style to
make them more visibly obvious on the page, e.g. a big red
border.
*/

*[style] {
	@include highlight("inline styles"); // Style to make the elements noticeable
}

/*
## Faulty or Missing Link Targets

These selectors will highlight any anchor elements that
either do not have any href attribute at all, or have a
meaningless one.
*/

a:not([href]) 
a[href="#"], 
a[href=""], 
a[href*="javascript:void(0)"] {
	@include highlight("faulty or missing link target");
} 


/*
## Unaccessible Images

As a blanket rule, all images should have an alt attribute.
When this attribute is missing, most screenreaders will read
out the value of the src attribute instead which, of course, is
not useful to the user and can in fact be confusing.
*/

img:not([alt]) {
	@include highlight("unaccessible image");
} 

/*
It should be noted that the above selector will not select
images with a null/empty alt attribute, i.e. images with alt="".
This is because a null alt attribute can be an intentional way
of having a screen reader skip over the image, which is useful
if, for example, the image is purely decorative. It could,
however, still be useful to have these highlighted, which we can
do with the following selector -
*/

img[alt=""] {
	@include highlight("unaccessible image");
} 

/*
## Missing Document Language

An important attribute that should be present on all html
elements is the language attribute. This attribute is a signal
to screen readers what language the page is in, which can
determine how the content of the page is read aloud.
*/

html:not([lang]), 
html[lang=""] {
	@include highlight("missing document language");
} 

/*

## Incorrect Character Set

This selector targets any meta character set tag that is not
set to UTF-8. This tag tells the browser to use the UTF-8 form
of character encoding, which is presently the recommended form
for HTML documents. Having this tag is therefore required for
valid HTML.

*/

meta[charset]:not([charset="UTF-8"]) {
	@include highlight("incorrect character set");
} 

/*
Ideally, this tag should also be the first element after the
opening <head> tag. We can check for this using the following
selector -
*/

meta[charset]:not(:first-child) {
	@include highlight("charset metatag should be first element in &lt;head&gt;");
} 

/*
## Unaccessible Viewport Attributes

This selector can be used to highlight unaccessible viewport
meta attributes. It is generally advised that we avoid
restricting the user's ability to manipulate the viewport by
shrinking and enlarging it. So, using user-scalable=no,
maximum-scale, or minimum-scale should never be used.

*/
meta[name="viewport"][content*="user-scalable=no"], 
meta[name="viewport"][content*="maximum-scale"], 
meta[name="viewport"][content*="minimum-scale"] {
	@include highlight("unaccessible viewport attributes");
} 

/*

## Unlabelled Form Elements

Form elements are perhaps the most important elements when it
comes to labelling. Although there are several ways to label a
form element, the most common way is by having an ID on the
element that is referenced by a label element. The above
selector checks for form elements that do not have an ID, and
label elements that are not explicitly linked to a form element
using the for attribute.

*/
input:not([id]), 
select:not([id]), 
textarea:not([id]) {
	@include highlight("unlabeled form element");
}

label:not([for]) {
	@include highlight("label not linked to input element");
} 

/*
Another type of labelling that is important for form elements is
via the name attribute. While the id attribute is used for
labelling the element in the context of the HTML document, the
name attribute is used to reference the the element when
submitted with the form data.
*/

input:not([name]), 
select:not([name]), 
textarea:not([name]) {
	@include highlight("missing name attribute");
} 

/*
Additionally, besides the form elements themselves, it is
useful to give the form element itself a name and/or id.
This selector will highlight any form element that is missing
both name and id attributes.
*/

form:not([name]):not([id]) {
	@include highlight("missing name and id on form element");
} 

/*

## Empty Interactive Elements

Interactive elements like links or buttons are typically
labelled by their content. Although it is possible to label
these elements using other methods, such as an aria-label
attribute, having them be empty is likely a sign of something
wrong. This selector will highlight any links of buttons that
have no HTML content inside them.
*/

button:empty, 
a:empty {
	@include highlight("empty interactive element");
} 


/*
## Unnecessary or Deprecated Attributes

Finally, we can use CSS selectors to highlight attributes in our
HTML that are deprecated or no longer needed.
*/

script[type="text/javascript"], 
link[rel="stylesheet"][type="text/css"] {
	@include highlight("unnecessary or deprecated attribute");
}
